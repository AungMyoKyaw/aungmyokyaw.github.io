# PRD vs. SRS vs. SDD

Understanding the distinctions between a Product Requirements Document (PRD), a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), and a Software Design Document (SDD) is crucial for effective product development. While they are all critical documents, they serve different purposes and are created at different stages of the development lifecycle.

## 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A PRD focuses on the **"what"** of the product â€” what it is, who it's for, and what it should do from a user's perspective. It's a strategic document that outlines the product's vision, features, and goals, ensuring that everyone involved has a shared understanding of what's being built and why.

- **Purpose**: To define the product's purpose, features, and functionality from a high level. It bridges the gap between the business objectives and the product being developed.
- **Audience**: Product managers, business stakeholders, marketing teams, and the development team leadership.
- **Content**:
  - **Introduction and Vision**: The problem the product solves and the overall vision.
  - **Goals and Objectives**: What the product aims to achieve, often tied to business metrics.
  - **Target Audience**: Detailed personas of the intended users.
  - **User Stories and Scenarios**: Descriptions of how users will interact with the product.
  - **Features and Functionality**: A high-level list of features and what they do.
  - **Release Criteria**: What needs to be completed for the product to be considered ready for release.
  - **Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies**: Any known limitations or external factors.

### Example: The "ConnectSphere" News Feed (PRD Snippet)

> **Goal**: Increase user engagement by 20% in the first quarter post-launch.
>
> **User Stories**:
>
> 1.  **As a professional**, I want to see recent updates from my connections and followed companies so that I can stay informed about my industry.
> 2.  **As a user**, I want to be able to 'like' and 'comment' on posts so that I can interact with my network and share my thoughts.
>
> **Features**:
>
> - **View Feed**: Users will see a chronological feed of the latest posts from their network.
> - **Create Post**: Users can create new posts with text and images.
> - **Interact with Posts**: Users can "like" and "comment" on any post in their feed.

### Key Considerations for PRD

- **Focus on the "Why"**: A great PRD doesn't just list features; it explains the user problems they solve and the business value they deliver. This context is vital for the team to make informed decisions.
- **Collaborative Creation**: While the Product Manager typically owns the PRD, it should be created with input from engineering, design, and other stakeholders to ensure feasibility and alignment.
- **Avoid Technical Details**: The PRD should be solution-agnostic. It defines the problem, leaving the technical implementation details for the SRS and SDD.
- **In Agile Contexts**: In agile development, the PRD might not be a single, massive document. It can be a living document, like a well-organized collection of epics and user stories in a tool like Jira or Confluence. The key is that the information is captured and shared, not the format.

## 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

An SRS translates the high-level vision of the PRD into a detailed, technical description of the software's requirements. It focuses on the **"what"** from a system's perspective, detailing both functional and non-functional requirements.

- **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive description of the system to be developed, including its functional and non-functional requirements. It serves as the single source of truth for the development team.
- **Audience**: Developers, QA testers, system architects, and technical managers.
- **Content**:
  - **Functional Requirements**: Detailed descriptions of the system's behavior, inputs, and outputs. This includes calculations, data manipulation, and processing.
  - **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**: The quality attributes of the system, such as:
    - **Performance**: Response times, throughput.
    - **Scalability**: Ability to handle load.
    - **Security**: Access controls, data encryption.
    - **Reliability**: Uptime, error handling.
    - **Usability**: Ease of use, accessibility.
  - **External Interfaces**: How the software will interact with other systems, hardware, or users.
  - **Data Models**: Descriptions of the data structures and databases.

### Example: The "ConnectSphere" News Feed (SRS Snippet)

> **Functional Requirements**:
>
> - **FN-FEED-1.1**: The system shall display the 50 most recent posts from the user's first-degree connections upon request.
> - **FN-FEED-1.2**: The system shall allow users to create posts containing up to 500 characters of text.
> - **FN-FEED-1.3**: The system shall support image uploads in JPEG and PNG format, with a maximum file size of 5MB.
>
> **Non-Functional Requirements**:
>
> - **NFN-PERF-1.1**: The News Feed API endpoint must respond within 500ms on average.
> - **NFN-SEC-1.1**: All user-generated content must be sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
> - **NFN-AVAIL-1.1**: The News Feed service must maintain 99.9% uptime.

### Key Considerations for SRS

- **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Requirements in an SRS must be clear, concise, and testable. Vague statements lead to misinterpretation and defects.
- **Distinguish from Design**: The SRS should define _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. For example, it might specify "the system must authenticate users," but not "the system will use JWT tokens for authentication."
- **Testability is Key**: Every requirement should be verifiable. If you can't write a test case for a requirement, it's not well-defined.
- **In Agile Contexts**: Similar to the PRD, a formal SRS document may be replaced by a well-maintained backlog of user stories with detailed acceptance criteria. NFRs are often handled as cross-cutting concerns or specific stories.

## 3. Software Design Document (SDD)

The SDD is the blueprint for how the software will be built. It takes the requirements from the SRS and outlines the technical solution, focusing on the **"how"**. It describes the system's architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data.

- **Purpose**: To detail the technical design and architecture of the software, providing a roadmap for the development team.
- **Audience**: Primarily the development team (including new members who need to onboard), and system architects.
- **Content**:
  - **System Architecture**: A high-level overview of the system's structure (e.g., microservices, monolithic, client-server).
  - **High-Level Design**: The overall system design, breaking it down into major components and their interactions.
  - **Low-Level Design**: Detailed design of each component, including class diagrams, data structures, algorithms, and API specifications.
  - **Database Design**: Schema, tables, relationships, and stored procedures.
  - **Interface Design**: Details of APIs (e.g., REST endpoints) and user interfaces.
  - **Technology Stack**: The programming languages, frameworks, and tools to be used.

### Example: The "ConnectSphere" News Feed (SDD Snippet)

> **1. System Architecture**
> The News Feed will be a standalone microservice (`feed-service`) that communicates with `user-service` and `post-service` via REST APIs. This ensures separation of concerns and independent scalability.
>
> **2. API Design (`feed-service`)**
>
> ```
> GET /api/v1/feed
>
> Auth: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}
>
> Response (200 OK):
> {
>   "posts": [
>     {
>       "postId": "uuid-xyz-123",
>       "authorId": "uuid-abc-456",
>       "authorName": "John Doe",
>       "content": "Excited to share my new project!",
>       "imageUrl": "https://.../image.png",
>       "likesCount": 42,
>       "commentsCount": 5
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> **3. Database Design**
> We will use a Redis cache to store pre-generated feeds for active users for fast lookups. The primary data for posts will reside in a PostgreSQL database within the `post-service`.

### Key Considerations for SDD

- **Justify Design Choices**: A good SDD explains _why_ certain design decisions were made. This helps future developers understand the trade-offs and rationale behind the architecture.
- **Multiple Levels of Detail**: An SDD can have both high-level (architectural) and low-level (module-specific) sections. This allows different audiences to get the information they need.
- **Visuals are Powerful**: Use diagrams (e.g., UML, sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams) to illustrate complex concepts.
- **In Agile Contexts**: Design is often an emergent process in agile. Instead of a single, upfront SDD, design documentation might be created iteratively. This could take the form of architecture decision records (ADRs), lightweight design docs for specific features, or well-documented code and APIs. The focus is on "just enough" documentation at the right time.
