# SLC PRD Template — Simple, Lovable, Complete

## 1. Overview

- Project name:
- Date:
- Owner / PM:
- Team:

## 2. Target

- Persona (1):
  - Short bio / context:
  - Why this persona?
- Job-to-be-done (JTBD): "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."
- Success metric(s):
  - Primary activation event (what counts as success?):
  - Secondary metrics (retention, conversion, time-to-success):

## 3. Scope — Simple (what's IN)

- Core features (list the minimum features required to achieve activation):
  1.
  2.
  3.
- ## Explicitly out-of-scope (things we will NOT build now):

## 4. Lovability (1–3 items)

- Lovability item 1: (describe, why it matters, rough effort)
- Lovability item 2: (optional)
- Lovability item 3: (optional)

## 5. Completeness & reliability

- Happy-path acceptance criteria (step-by-step):
  1.
  2.
  3.
- ## Error handling & edge cases to cover (minimally):
- Accessibility & performance baseline (must-haves):
  - Accessibility: keyboard nav, color contrast, ARIA labels (as required)
  - Performance: load time target for core screen(s)

## 6. Analytics & measurement

- ## Event list to instrument (activation, key steps, errors):
- ## Dashboards / alerts required before launch:
- ## User feedback plan (qual interviews, in-app survey, NPS):

## 7. Launch plan

- Dogfood plan (internal testing):
- Beta / closed release plan (who, how long):
- Public launch checklist:
  - Docs / help copy
  - Support channel prepared
  - Post-launch monitoring (errors, retention)

## 8. Risks & rollbacks

- ## Known risks and mitigation:
- ## Rollback criteria (when to pause/shutdown the feature):

## 9. Post-launch

- Initial evaluation window (e.g., 2 weeks) and criteria for pivot/iterate/expand:
- Next steps if successful (scale, new personas, adjacent features):
