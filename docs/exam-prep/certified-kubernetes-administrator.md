## üìä Visual Study Plan

Below is a high-level study flow to help you prioritize topics and practice time. The diagram shows focus areas and recommended study order (start at "Foundations").

:::tip üåê Community & Supplementary Resources

- **GitHub CKA Guide:** The [Cloud-Native-Islamabad/Certified-Kubernetes-Administrator-CKA-Guide-2025](https://github.com/Cloud-Native-Islamabad/Certified-Kubernetes-Administrator-CKA-Guide-2025) repository is an excellent collection of resources, links, and information.
- **Reddit:** The [r/CKAExam](https://reddit.com/r/CKAExam) and [r/kubernetes](https://reddit.com/r/kubernetes) subreddits are great places to find tips, ask questions, and learn from the experiences of others.

:::caution üßë‚Äçüíª Hands-On Practice (The Key to Success)
**Killer.sh:** The official CKA exam simulator provided by the Linux Foundation. You get two free sessions when you register for the exam. The simulator is known to be more difficult than the actual exam, so don't be discouraged if you struggle with it. It's an excellent tool for identifying your weak areas.

**Killercoda:** Offers free, interactive, browser-based Kubernetes scenarios. It's a great way to get quick hands-on practice without setting up your own environment.

**Local Kubernetes Environments:**

- **Minikube:** Run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.
- **kubeadm:** The exam environment is built with kubeadm, so it's highly recommended to practice setting up and managing a cluster using this tool. You can use virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware to create a multi-node cluster.
  :::

:::info üìö Essential Documentation

- **Official Kubernetes Documentation:** Since this is the only external resource allowed during the exam, you must be proficient at navigating and searching it. Practice finding information on topics like deployments, services, networking policies, and storage.
- **Kubernetes Blog:** Also allowed during the exam, the blog can provide useful context and examples.

## üóìÔ∏è 8-Week Study Plan

This is a suggested timeline. Feel free to adjust it based on your experience and schedule.

<details>
<summary><strong>Weeks 1-2: Foundations</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Understand core Kubernetes concepts.

- [ ] Go through the "Coursera Courses & Specializations" learning path
- [ ] Focus on understanding the Kubernetes architecture (control plane, worker nodes, etc.)
- [ ] Get comfortable with basic kubectl commands
- [ ] Learn about Pods, Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Services

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Weeks 3-4: Cluster Administration & Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Tackle the two most heavily weighted domains.

- [ ] Practice installing clusters with kubeadm
- [ ] Learn how to back up and restore the etcd database
- [ ] Dive deep into troubleshooting (kubectl logs, describe, get events)
- [ ] Work through troubleshooting scenarios on Killercoda or in your own lab

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Weeks 5-6: Networking, Scheduling, and Storage</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Cover the remaining exam domains.

- [ ] Networking: Learn about NetworkPolicies, Ingress, Egress, and CoreDNS
- [ ] Scheduling: Understand taints, tolerations, node affinity, and anti-affinity
- [ ] Storage: Work with PersistentVolumes (PVs), PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), and StorageClasses

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Week 7: Intensive Practice & Mock Exams</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Build speed and confidence.

- [ ] Take your first Killer.sh session. Analyze your results and identify weak areas
- [ ] Redo the labs from your primary course, focusing on speed
- [ ] Practice using imperative commands (kubectl create deployment, kubectl expose, etc.) to save time

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Week 8: Review and Final Prep</strong></summary>

**Goal:** Consolidate your knowledge and prepare for exam day.

- [ ] Take your second Killer.sh session. You should see a significant improvement
- [ ] Review your notes, especially on your weak topics
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the exam environment and rules

:::tip üèÜ Exam Tips
**Time Management:**

- [ ] The exam is fast-paced. If you're stuck on a question, flag it and come back to it later.

**kubectl Aliases:**

- [ ] Set up aliases like `alias k=kubectl` to save time.

**Context is Key:**

- [ ] Always ensure you're in the correct cluster and namespace by running `kubectl config get-contexts` and `kubectl config use-context <context_name>`.

**YAML from Scratch is a Trap:**

- [ ] Avoid writing YAML files from scratch. Use imperative commands with `--dry-run=client -o yaml` to generate the basic structure and then modify it.

**Don't Panic:**

- [ ] Stay calm and focused. If you've prepared well, you have the knowledge to pass.

## üßæ Quick Cheatsheet & Exam-Day Checklist

Use this compact cheatsheet during last-week review sessions and memorize or pin the checklist for exam day.

### Kubectl quick commands

```bash
k get nodes # nodes and status
k get pods -A # all pods across namespaces
k describe pod <pod> # pod troubleshooting
k logs -f <pod> # stream logs from pod
k exec -it <pod> -- /bin/sh # run a shell inside a pod (or /bin/bash)
k apply -f <file.yaml> # apply a manifest
k create deployment <name> --image=<image> --replicas=1
k rollout status deployment/<name>
k get pvc,pv # storage objects
k get events -A # cluster events
```

Tip: create aliases in your environment (e.g., `alias k=kubectl`) and practice using `--dry-run=client -o yaml` to scaffold manifests.

### Exam-Day Checklist

- [ ] Confirm exam time, timezone, and ID documents
- [ ] Ensure a quiet, uninterrupted workspace and stable internet
- [ ] Have two forms of identification ready (as per Linux Foundation rules)
- [ ] Open the official Kubernetes docs and practice quick-searching with Ctrl+F
- [ ] Set up kubectl aliases and adjust terminal font/size for readability
- [ ] Keep an emergency plan (breaks, technical issues): contact exam support number
- [ ] Breathe and manage time: flag hard tasks and move on; return later

Good luck with your CKA journey!
