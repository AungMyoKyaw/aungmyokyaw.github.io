## üìù About

**meta-knowledge** is my personal knowledge base and public notes repository. Here, I curate, organize, and share information, ideas, and resources that I want to save and publish for myself and others. The site is built and published using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), making it easy to browse and contribute.

It encourages open learning and creative contribution, while respecting the rights of original authors.

## Enabling Mermaid diagrams (Docusaurus v3)

To render Mermaid diagrams in your Markdown, install the official Mermaid theme and enable Mermaid support in `docusaurus.config.ts`.

Install the theme with your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save @docusaurus/theme-mermaid

# Using yarn
yarn add @docusaurus/theme-mermaid

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @docusaurus/theme-mermaid

# Using bun
bun add @docusaurus/theme-mermaid
```

Then, in `docusaurus.config.ts`, make sure you have:

```ts
markdown: { mermaid: true },
themes: ['@docusaurus/theme-mermaid'],
```

You can now add Mermaid code blocks in Markdown using the `mermaid` language identifier:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD;
	A --> B;
```
````
