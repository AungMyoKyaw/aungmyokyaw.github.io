# 📚 meta-knowledge

## Icon Usage

This project uses [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) for icons instead of emojis, for a more consistent and customizable UI. To use an icon, import it from `lucide-react` and use it as a React component:

```tsx
import { Trophy } from 'lucide-react';

<Trophy size={20} className="margin-right--sm" aria-label="Trophy" />;
```

Replace any emoji usage in React components with the appropriate Lucide icon for better accessibility and design consistency.
