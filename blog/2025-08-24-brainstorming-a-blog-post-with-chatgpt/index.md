As a programmer, I spend a significant amount of time typing, which can lead to fatigue. I’ve been using ChatGPT and other AI tools daily, mostly through typing, but I recently decided to experiment with voice interaction.

The idea was simple: instead of typing out my thoughts, I would speak them out and let ChatGPT help me shape them into a blog post. This method has a couple of key benefits for me. First, it’s faster. Even though my pronunciation isn’t perfect yet, I can already feel the potential for speed as I practice. Second, it’s more engaging and less tiring than typing, especially after long hours at the computer.

One challenge I’ve encountered is my pronunciation, which makes voice typing slower than hand typing right now. But I’m optimistic that with practice, I’ll get faster and more fluent. This process not only helps me write more efficiently but also improves my English speaking skills, which is a big bonus.

In the future, I envision using this method not just for blog posts but for troubleshooting and getting quick help from AI by simply speaking my queries. It’s an exciting journey, and I’m looking forward to seeing how this evolves!
