Welcome to my digital garden! ðŸŒ±

<!-- truncate -->

I don't even remember how many times I've tried to start a blog. I'd set up the environment, write a little, then stop, then start again, and then stop again. I can't even remember most of them.

Maybe this time will be different.

Actually, this time it's not just about blogging. I'll use my blog to write about any topic or whatever I want to write, just for practicing my English.

Actually, this post will be edited by an AI after I have written it.

The difference is, before the age of AI, I didn't dare to start writing because I know my English sucks.

I don't want to show the public how much I suck at English.

But now it's okay. Now I can just keep writing, even with my sucky English, and an AI will fix it for me.

Maybe I can learn something from it.

I will make sure it just fixes the grammar and spelling mistakes, without changing the meaning of the sentences.

So, that's the reason I decided to start my digital garden.

Another thing is, I'm thinking about building a personal knowledge management system.

I know I already have an Obsidian vault, so I don't need to publish my notes publicly.

But I think I might be more motivated if I keep some of my projects and notes public so I can continue to work on them.

So this is another reason.

As for blogging, I think there may not be many posts. I'll just write whenever I feel like it.

BTW i would like to share the prompts that I used to fix the grammar and spelling mistakes in this post:
Here it is:
