Hello. Testing 1-2-3.

This is my first time for voice typing, so it will be very slower than normal.

Okay, I think it's better if we start by talking about why I need to take the IELTS exam. To be very clear, when I was in Singapore, I considered getting a master's degree in something related to computer science. So I'm applying for the Information Systems program at NTU. They require me to have at least an IELTS score of 5.5.

I'm taking the test, but maybe I think it's too early to take the test because I'm busy with relocating. I've never been to Singapore before; I just arrived, and I'm also busy because it's a new place. I took the exam, but I haven't done any training. I'm sure I should.

So I went to the British Council, and in the morning, I took the speaking exam. I don't think I did very well because I didn't prepare anything. I think in the exam, the examiner chose one topic for me, and I had some time , I think it was one or two minutes, Then, I had to speak about this topic. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't prepare anything, so I didn't know what to say. I tried my best to talk as much as I could, but my speaking was slow. I was thinking a lot before speaking, so it was really bad.

I thought I would do better on the listening session than the speaking session. However, it didn't go well. Even though I'm very familiar with the American accent, the speakers were using a UK accent, so I couldn't understand them. As a result, I had to guess on all the answers and ended up with a bad score.

I thought I would do a good job on the reading session. I believed this because I read a lot, so I was confident I would do well. However, the reading session was more complicated than the listening session. I encountered many unfamiliar words and didn't even know their meaning.

The writing session wasn't as bad as I expected, but my overall score was very low. I don't even want to mention it here; I feel like I just wasted my money, so my band score will remain a secret for now. I know I have to improve a lot. My pronunciation is also very bad; even my computer doesn't understand what I'm saying. I have to do a lot of editing, which isn't a good sign. But I'm writing this post because I believe I will get better at English in the future and maybe even achieve a high score on the IELTS. Then, I can come back to this post and see how far I've come.
